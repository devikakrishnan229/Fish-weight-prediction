# Fish Species Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the species of fish based on various features such as weight, length, height, etc. 
It utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically classification algorithms, to achieve this prediction. The model is trained on the Fish Market dataset sourced from Kaggle.
